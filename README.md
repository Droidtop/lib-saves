# lib-saves

Where a game keeps its saves, and the copies kept of them. One of the shared library families of Droidtop/tracker#867: the libraries belong to no program;
each program has its own scaffold and pins a tagged release of each library it uses (#867 D2).

| Crate | Where | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `saves-locate` | [`crates/locate`](crates/locate) | save locations (the person's entries, Ludusavi's data, engine rules, Wine and Proton prefixes) and kept copies |

Used by: droidtop-agent (and through it droidtop); Pythia once its native module moves on.

Licence: GPL-3.0-only (see `LICENSE`).

## Where the code came from

#867 step 1 moves existing code before changing it ("reuse and contract first, rewrites second"). These
crates are droidtop-agent's, moved as they were:
  - `saves-locate` from droidtop-agent `0ec4110` `crates/saves`

Only the package names changed. Code still imports each crate by its old name (`droidtop_agent_*`), so
nothing that uses it had to be edited; renaming the imports is a later, mechanical change.

## Build and test

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs those on Linux, Windows and macOS. It then builds and tests every
program that uses this library against the commit (#867 D2). Work lands on `main` from `ci/*` branches
once CI is green.

## Versions

**The interface stays compatible within a version** (Droidtop/tracker#867, owner 2026-11-04: "I should be able to
bump the version number and immediately get the benefit"). A program takes a fix by moving its pin, with no change
to its own code. CI's `semver` job runs `cargo-semver-checks` against the last release: a breaking change fails unless
the version says so (in 0.x, a new minor version) and the CHANGELOG says what broke and what a program changes.

A release is a tag `vX.Y.Z`. CI creates it on a green `main` whose root `Cargo.toml` names a version not
yet tagged, so to release, raise that version (and the CHANGELOG) in the change that needs it. Programs,
and the other libraries, depend on a tag:

```toml
droidtop-agent-core = { package = "sync-core", git = "https://github.com/Droidtop/lib-sync", tag = "v0.1.0" }
```
